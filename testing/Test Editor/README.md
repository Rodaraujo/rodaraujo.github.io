# Podcast RSS Editor
Started a [design podcast](https://anyway.fm/) couple of years ago, and in the very beginning, I manually updated the RSS feed for every episode and very soon, I got sick of the 'tag dancing', so tried a little bit building this tool, a very simple Podcast RSS editor in PHP for myself.
